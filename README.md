- Mario Matthews Gunawan (2206810452)

This is a simple e-commerce application built in C, designed to allow users to create seller and buyer accounts, log in, and perform basic account management operations. The program uses OpenMP for parallel processing and basic file handling to store data.

## Features

- **Account Management:**
  - Create a seller or buyer account.
  - Only one seller and one buyer account can be created.
- **Login System:**

  - Log in with the created seller or buyer account.

- **Parallel Execution:**
  - Uses OpenMP to handle account creation and login in parallel.

## Requirements

- **C Compiler:** A C compiler that supports OpenMP (e.g., GCC).
- **Libraries:** The program uses the following libraries:
  - `stdio.h` for input/output operations.
  - `string.h` for string manipulation.
  - `stdlib.h` for memory management.
  - `omp.h` for OpenMP parallelism.
  - `windows.h` for system functions like `Sleep()` and `Beep()`.
